## Main Goal :rocket:
Our idea is to create a platform to be the median in which makes delivery of items between indeviduals easier and more flixable. The delivery process begins when a person signup to the platform and create a DROP order, then he/she will select the person whom recieving this package, the package details, the closest store in which the package will stay until the authorized person pick it up.

## Architecture 
The platform is a web application consist of two parts, the Frontend, and the Backend.
### The Frontend
We are using Angular 8 to create an interactive user interfaces for the platform. We use Typescript to achieve that.

### The Backend
The backend is written in Python using Django as the framework.
